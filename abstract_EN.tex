The American students are part of one of the most ambitious undertakings %
in the history of education: the American effort to educate an entire %
national population. The goal is-and has been since the early decades %
of the republic-to achieve universal literacy and to provide individuals %
with the knowledge and skills necessary to promote both their own %
individual welfare as well as that of the general public. Though %
this goal has not yet been fully achieved, it remains an ideal toward %
which has been made is notable both for its scope and for the educational %
methods which have been developed in the process of achieving it.


About 85\% of American students attend public schools. The other 15\% attend private schools, for which their families choose to pay special attendance fees. Four out of five primate schools in the United States are run by churches, synagogues or other religious groups. In such schools, religious teachings are a part of the curriculum, which also includes the traditional academic courses of reading, mathematics, history, geography and science.
