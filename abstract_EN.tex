With the explosive growth of information, search engine has already become indispensable for people to obtain information and knowledge. The search engine always returns the most relevant web pages according to the users' queries. The traditional search engine simply matches the query words and web pages, it cannot understand the users' intent. How to make itself become more intelligent is urgent.

Since Google proposed the Knowledge Graph, knowledge base has brought hope for the intelligentized search engines. Users can not only obtain the relevant web pages, but also get more intelligent information. Generally, a KB consists of billions of fact triplets, which contains large number of entities and relations. Although KB has been widely used in many AI systems, it still suffers from its limited coverage.

To effectively address KB's limited coverage, we propose a novel method to jointly embed knowledge base and text into the same continuous low-dimensional vector space so as to reason the new facts. We require the embedding vector
of an entity not only to fit the structured constraints in KB but also to be equal to the embedding vector computed from the text description. In contrast to the previous methods, our model can reason the missing facts which contain entities out of the KB, and aslo does not need any manually labeled information.

In order to prove the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the existed datasets, including link prediction,
triple classification and analogical reasoning. We also verify our model through the relational fact extraction task. All these show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline systems.
